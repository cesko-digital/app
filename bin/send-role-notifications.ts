/**
 * Send notifications about new roles to interested users
 *
 * The roles are read from the [Notifications for Today][1] Airtable view.
 * The basic idea is to take opportunities that are live and have been published
 * just two days ago.
 *
 * The recipients are read from the [New Role Notification Recipients][2] view.
 * The filter picks users that have notifications turned on and have subscribed
 * to new role notifications.
 *
 * **BEWARE**: Make sure to only run this once a day at most, otherwise recipients
 * will receive duplicate notifications.
